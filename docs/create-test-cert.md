# Hyperledger Fabric chaincode kit (CCKit)

## X.509 certificate for testing

generate self-signed certificate:

```
$ openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt > some-person.key.pem
$ openssl req -new -x509 -key some-person.key.pem -out some-person.pem -days 730
```

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.


examine the certificate:

`$ openssl x509 -in some-person.pem -text -noout`
